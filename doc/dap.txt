*dap.txt* Debug Adapter Protocol support for neovim


nvim-dap implements the Debug Adapter Protocol.

  https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/


Neovim acts as the client for the debug adapter protocol and provides features
to launch debug adapters, debugee's and to then step through code and explore
the state of the application being debugged.


                                      Type |gO| to see the table of contents.

==============================================================================
ADAPTER CONFIGURATION                                *dap-adapters*


Neovim needs a debug-adapter with which it can communicate. Neovim can either
launch the debug-adapter itself, or it can attach to an existing one.


To tell Neovim if it should launch a debug adapter or connect to one, and if
so, how, you need to configure them via the `dap.adapters` table. The key of
the table is an arbitrary name that debug adapters are looked up by when using
a |dap-configuration|.

For example, to register a debug-adapter under the type `python`:

>
    lua << EOF
    local dap = require('dap')
    dap.adapters.python = {
      type = 'executable';
      command = os.getenv('HOME') .. '/.virtualenvs/tools/bin/python';
      args = { '-m', 'debugpy.adapter' };
    }
    EOF


`dap.adapters.<name>` is set to a `Adapter`.

The `Adapter` needs to contain a `type`, which can be one of:

- `executable`, to indicate that Neovim must launch the debug-adapter.
- `server`, to indicate that Neovim can connect to an already running
  debug-adapter.

For `executable` the following options are supported:

>
    command: string     -- command to invoke
    args:    string[]   -- arguments for the command
    options?: {
      env?: {}          -- Set the environment variables for the command
      cwd?: string      -- Set the working directory for the command
    }

For `server` the following options are supported:

>
    host?: string       -- host to connect to, defaults to 127.0.0.1
    port:  number       -- port to connect to


`dap.adapters.<name>` can also be set to a function which takes one argument.
This argument is a callback which must be called with the adapter table.

This can be used to defer the resolving of the values to when a configuration
is used. An example use is java with eclipse.jdt.ls and java-debug, where the
debug-adapter is spawned via a LSP command:
>

    dap.adapters.java = function(callback)
      M.execute_command({command = 'vscode.java.startDebugSession'}, function(err0, port)
        assert(not err0, vim.inspect(err0))

        callback({ type = 'server'; host = '127.0.0.1'; port = port; })
      end)
    end
<


There is an additional `enrich_config` property available for both adapter
types. This property is a function which allows an adapter to enrich a
configuration with additional information. It receives a configuration as first
argument, and a callback that must be called with the final configuration as
second argument.

An example use-case of this is the Java Debug Adapter, which can resolve
classPaths or modulePaths dynamically, so that users don't have to do that.

>


    local adapter = {
      type = 'server';
      host = '127.0.0.1';
      port = 8080;
      enrich_config = function(config, on_config)
        local final_config = vim.deepcopy(config)
        final_config.extra_property = 'This got injected by the adapter'
        on_config(final_config)
      end;
    }

==============================================================================
DEBUGEE CONFIGURATION                                *dap-configuration*


In addition to having to know how to (launch) and connect to a debug-adapter,
Neovim needs to instruct the debug-adapter how to launch the debugee or how to
connect to it. The debugee is the application you want to debug.

This is configured via a `Configuration`, a `Configuration` has 3 required
fields:

>
    type: string        -- References the Adapter to use
    request: string     -- Either `attach` or `launch`, indicates if the
                        -- debug-adapter in turn should launch a debugee or if
                        -- it can attach to a debugee.
    name: string        -- A user readable name for the configuration
<

It takes any number of further options which are debug-adapter specific.

The configurations are set via the `dap.configurations` table. The keys are
filetypes. If you run |dap-continue| it will look up configurations under the
current files filetype.

An example:

>
    lua << EOF
    local dap = require('dap')
    dap.configurations.python = {
      {
        type = 'python';
        request = 'launch';
        name = "Launch file";
        program = "${file}";
        pythonPath = function(adapter)
          local cwd = vim.fn.getcwd()
          if vim.fn.executable(cwd .. '/venv/bin/python') then
            return cwd .. '/venv/bin/python'
          elseif vim.fn.executable(cwd .. '/.venv/bin/python') then
            return cwd .. '/.venv/bin/python'
          else
            return '/usr/bin/python'
          end
        end;
      },
    }
    EOF


Things to note:

- Values for properties other than the 3 required properties can be functions,
  they will be evaluated once the configuration is used.

- Some variables are supported:

  - `${file}`: Active filename
  - `${workspaceFolder}`: The current working directory of Neovim


==============================================================================
DEBUGEE CONFIGURATION via launch.json                *dap-launch.json*

nvim-dap supports a small subset of the `launch.json` file that is used to
configure debug adapters in Visual Studio Code.

To load the configurations, add the following in `init.vim`:

>

  lua require('dap.ext.vscode').load_launchjs()

<

This extends `dap.configurations` each time it is called, so make sure to only
call it once.

            {condition}     Optional condition that must be met for the debugger
                            to stop at the breakpoint.
            {hit_condition} Optional hit condition, e.g. a number as a string
                            that tells how often this breakpoint should be visited
                            to stop.
            {log_message}   Optional log message. This transforms the breakpoint 
                            into a log point. Variable interpolation with {foo} is
                            supported within the message.

list_breakpoints()                                     *dap.list_breakpoints()*

        Lists all breakpoints and log points in quickfix window.

    debug adapter.

    Parameters: ~
        {filters}          A list of exception types to stop on (optional).
                           Most debug adapters offer categories like `"uncaught"` and
                           `"raised"` to filter the exceptions.
                           If set to "default" instead of a table, the
                           default options as recommended by the debug adapter are
                           used.
        {exceptionOptions} ExceptionOptions[]?

        Requests the debugee to step into a function or method if possible.
        If it cannot step into a function or method it behaves like
        |dap.step_over()|.

        Parameters: ~
            {winopts}  optional table which may include:
                        `height` to set the window height

                        Any other key/value pair, that will be treated as window
                        option.

        The REPL can be used to evaluate expressions. A `omnifunc` is set to
        support completion of expressions. It supports the following special
        commands:

          .exit               Closes the REPL
