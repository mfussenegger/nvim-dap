DAP client                                           *dap.txt*


nvim-dap is a debug adapter protocol client, or "debugger", or "debug-frontend".

With the help of a debug-adapter it can:

- Launch an application to debug
- Attach to running applications to debug them
- Set breakpoints and step through code
- Inspect the state of the application

A debug-adapter is a facilitator between nvim-dap (the client), and a
language specific debugger:


    DAP-Client ----- Debug Adapter ------- Debugger ------ Debugee
    (nvim-dap)  |   (per language)  |   (per language)    (your app)
                |                   |
                |        Implementation specific communication
                |        Debug-adapter and debugger could be the same process
                |
         Communication via debug adapter protocol


To debug applications, you need to configure two things per language:

- A debug adapter (|dap-adapter|)
- How to launch your application to debug or how to attach to a running
  application (|dap-configuration|)

ADAPTER CONFIGURATION                                *dap-adapter*


Neovim needs a debug-adapter with which it can communicate. Neovim can either
launch the debug-adapter itself, or it can attach to an existing one.

To tell Neovim if it should launch a debug adapter or connect to one, and if
so, how, you need to configure them via the `dap.adapters` table. The key of
the table is an arbitrary name that debug adapters are looked up by when using
a |dap-configuration|.

For example, to register the `debugpy` debug-adapter under the type `python` you
can add the following entry:

>
    lua << EOF
    local dap = require('dap')
    dap.adapters.python = {
      type = 'executable';
      command = os.getenv('HOME') .. '/.virtualenvs/tools/bin/python';
      args = { '-m', 'debugpy.adapter' };
    }
    EOF


`dap.adapters.<name>` is set to a `Adapter`.

The `Adapter` needs to contain a `type`, which can be one of:

- `executable`, to indicate that nvim-dap must launch the debug-adapter. In
  this case nvim-dap will spawn the given process and communicate with it using
  stdio.

- `server`, to indicate that nvim-dap can connect to an already running
  debug-adapter via TCP.

For `executable` the following options are supported:

>
    command: string     -- command to invoke
    args:    string[]   -- arguments for the command
    options?: {
      env?: {}          -- Set the environment variables for the command
      cwd?: string      -- Set the working directory for the command
    }

For `server` the following options are supported:

>
    host?: string       -- host to connect to, defaults to 127.0.0.1
    port:  number       -- port to connect to


`dap.adapters.<name>` can also be set to a function which takes two arguments.
This first argument is a callback which must be called with the adapter table.
The second argument is the |dap-configuration| which the user wants to use.

This can be used to defer the resolving of the values to when a configuration
is used. An example use is java with eclipse.jdt.ls and java-debug, where the
debug-adapter is spawned via a LSP command:
>

    dap.adapters.java = function(callback, config)
      M.execute_command({command = 'vscode.java.startDebugSession'}, function(err0, port)
        assert(not err0, vim.inspect(err0))

        callback({ type = 'server'; host = '127.0.0.1'; port = port; })
      end)
    end
<


There is an additional `enrich_config` property available for both adapter
types. This property is a function which allows an adapter to enrich a
configuration with additional information. It receives a configuration as first
argument, and a callback that must be called with the final configuration as
second argument.

An example use-case of this is the Java Debug Adapter, which can resolve
classPaths or modulePaths dynamically, so that users don't have to do that.

>


    local adapter = {
      type = 'server';
      host = '127.0.0.1';
      port = 8080;
      enrich_config = function(config, on_config)
        local final_config = vim.deepcopy(config)
        final_config.extra_property = 'This got injected by the adapter'
        on_config(final_config)
      end;
    }

==============================================================================
DEBUGEE CONFIGURATION                                *dap-configuration*


In addition to having to know how to (launch) and connect to a debug-adapter,
Neovim needs to instruct the debug-adapter how to launch the debugee or how to
connect to it. The debugee is the application you want to debug.

This is configured via a `Configuration`, a `Configuration` has 3 required
fields:

>
    type: string        -- References the Adapter to use
    request: string     -- Either `attach` or `launch`, indicates if the
                        -- debug-adapter in turn should launch a debugee or if
                        -- it can attach to a debugee.
    name: string        -- A user readable name for the configuration
<

It takes any number of further options which are debug-adapter specific.

The configurations are set via the `dap.configurations` table. The keys are
filetypes. If you run |dap-continue| it will look up configurations under the
current files filetype.

An example:

>
    lua << EOF
    local dap = require('dap')
    dap.configurations.python = {
      {
        type = 'python';
        request = 'launch';
        name = "Launch file";
        program = "${file}";
        pythonPath = function()
          return '/usr/bin/python'
        end;
      },
    }
    EOF


Things to note:

- Values for properties other than the 3 required properties can be functions,
  they will be evaluated once the configuration is used.

- Some variables are supported:

  - `${file}`: Active filename
  - `${workspaceFolder}`: The current working directory of Neovim


==============================================================================
DEBUGEE CONFIGURATION via launch.json                *dap-launch.json*

nvim-dap supports a small subset of the `launch.json` file that is used to
configure debug adapters in Visual Studio Code.

To load the configurations, add the following in `init.vim`:

>

  lua require('dap.ext.vscode').load_launchjs()

<

This extends `dap.configurations` each time it is called, so make sure to only
call it once.

==============================================================================
SIGNS CONFIGURATION


nvim-dap uses three signs:

- `DapBreakpoint` which defaults to `B` for breakpoints
- `DapLogPoint` which defaults to `L` and is for log-points
- `DapStopped` which defaults to `→` and is used to indicate the position where
  the debugee is stopped.

You can customize the signs by overriding the definition after you've loaded `dap`.
An example:

>
    lua <<

    require('dap')
    vim.fn.sign_define('DapBreakpoint', {text='🛑', texthl='', linehl='', numhl=''})

    EOF
<

==============================================================================
REPL COMPLETION                                               *dap-completion*


nvim-dap includes an omnifunc implementation which uses the active debug
session to get completion candidates.

It is by default set within the REPL which means you can use `CTRL-X CTRL-O` to
trigger completion within the REPL.

You can also setup the completion to trigger automatically:

>
  au FileType dap-repl lua require('dap.ext.autocompl').attach()
<

Completion will then trigger automatically on any of the completion trigger
characters reported by the debug adapter or if none are reported on `.`.

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                             *dap-mappings*


Some example mappings:

>
    nnoremap <silent> <F5> :lua require'dap'.continue()<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> <F10> :lua require'dap'.step_over()<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> <F11> :lua require'dap'.step_into()<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> <F12> :lua require'dap'.step_out()<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> <leader>b :lua require'dap'.toggle_breakpoint()<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> <leader>B :lua require'dap'.set_breakpoint(vim.fn.input('Breakpoint condition: '))<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> <leader>lp :lua require'dap'.set_breakpoint(nil, nil, vim.fn.input('Log point message: '))<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> <leader>dr :lua require'dap'.repl.open()<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> <leader>dl :lua require'dap'.run_last()<CR>


==============================================================================
TERMINAL CONFIGURATION                               *dap-terminal*

Some debug adapters support launching the debugee in an integrated terminal or
an external terminal.

For that they usually provide a `console` option in their |dap-configuration|.
The supported values are usually called `internalConsole`, `integratedTerminal`
and `externalTerminal`.


If you want to use the `externalTerminal` you need to setup the terminal which
should be launched by nvim-dap:

>

  lua << EOF
  local dap = require('dap')
  dap.defaults.fallback.external_terminal = {
    command = '/usr/bin/alacritty';
    args = {'-e'};
  }
  EOF

<

`fallback` here can be replaced with the |dap-adapter| type to have type
specific terminal configurations.

continue()                                                      *dap.continue()*
        `continue()` resumes the execution of an application if a debug session
        is active and a thread was stopped.  Threads are usually stopped when a
        breakpoint is hit or an exception occurred.

        If no debug session is active, `continue()` will start a new debug session by:

        - Looking up the configurations (|dap-configuration|) for the current filetype.
        - If there is more than one configuration it will prompt the user to
          select one of them.
        - It calls |dap.run()| on the selected configuration.

        `continue()` is the main entry-point for users to start debugging an
        application.


run({config})                                                        *dap.run()*
        Looks up a debug adapter entry for the given configuration and runs it.
        This is implicitly called by |dap.continue()| if no debug session is
        active.

        Most users will want to start debugging using |dap.continue()| instead
        of using `run()`.  `run()` is intended for nvim-dap extensions which
        create configurations dynamically, for example to debug individual test
        cases.

        Parameters:
            {config}  |dap-configuration| to run


run_last()                                                      *dap.run_last()*
        Re-runs the last debug-adapter/configuration that ran using
        |dap.run()|.


launch({adapter}, {config})                                       *dap.launch()*
        Launch a new debug adapter and then initialize it with the given
        |dap-configuration|

        You typically do not want to call this directly but use
        |dap.continue()| or |dap.run()|

        Parameters: ~
            {adapter}   `Adapter` to launch, see |dap-adapter|, the `type` is
                        not required in this case.
            {config}    |dap-configuration|


attach({host}, {port}, {config})                                 *dap.attach()*
        Attach to a running debug adapter and then initialize it with the
        given |dap-configuration|

        You typically do not want to call this directly but use
        |dap.continue()| or |dap.run()|


set_breakpoint({condition}, {hit_condition}, {log_message})
                                                          *dap.set_breakpoint()*

        Same as |toggle_breakpoint|, but is guaranteed to overwrite previous 
        breakpoint.

toggle_breakpoint({condition}, {hit_condition}, {log_message})
                                                       *dap.toggle_breakpoint()*

        Creates or removes a breakpoint at the current line.

        Parameters: ~
            {condition}     Optional condition that must be met for the debugger
                            to stop at the breakpoint.
            {hit_condition} Optional hit condition, e.g. a number as a string
                            that tells how often this breakpoint should be visited
                            to stop.
            {log_message}   Optional log message. This transforms the breakpoint 
                            into a log point. Variable interpolation with {foo} is
                            supported within the message.

list_breakpoints()                                     *dap.list_breakpoints()*

        Lists all breakpoints and log points in quickfix window.

set_exception_breakpoints({filters}, {exceptionOptions})
                                              *dap.set_exception_breakpoints()*

    Sets breakpoints on exceptions filtered by `filters`. If `filters` is not
    provided it will prompt the user to choose from the available filters of the
    debug adapter.

    Parameters: ~
        {filters}          A list of exception types to stop on (optional).
                           Most debug adapters offer categories like `"uncaught"` and
                           `"raised"` to filter the exceptions.
                           If set to "default" instead of a table, the
                           default options as recommended by the debug adapter are
                           used.
        {exceptionOptions} ExceptionOptions[]?
                           (https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/specification#Types_ExceptionOptions)
         
    >
        -- Ask user to stop on which kinds of exceptions
        require'dap'.set_exception_breakpoints()
        -- don't stop on exceptions
        require'dap'.set_exception_breakpoints({})
        -- stop only on certain exceptions (debugpy offers "raised", "uncaught")
        require'dap'.set_exception_breakpoints({"uncaughted"})
        require'dap'.set_exception_breakpoints({"raised", "uncaught"})
        -- use default settings of debug adapter
        require'dap'.set_exception_breakpoints("default")
    <

    You can also set the default value via a `defaults.fallback` table:

    >
        require('dap').defaults.fallback.exception_breakpoints = {'raised'}
    <

    Or per config/adapter type:

    >
        require('dap').defaults.python.exception_breakpoints = {'raised'}
    <

    In this example `python` is the type. This is the same type used in
    |dap-configuration| or the |dap-adapter| definition.


step_over([{opts}])                                            *dap.step_over()*
        Requests the debugee to run again for one step.

        For {opts} see |step_into|.


step_into([{opts}])                                            *dap.step_into()*
        Requests the debugee to step into a function or method if possible.
        If it cannot step into a function or method it behaves like
        |dap.step_over()|.

        If the debug adapter has the `supportsStepInTargetsRequest` and  
        {ask_for_targets} is true, the user can choose into which function they
        want to step into if there are multiple.

        Some debug adapters allow a more fine-grained control over the
        behavior of this command using the {opts} parameter:

        steppingGranularity:
          Can be 'statement' | 'line' | 'instruction'
          Will fall back to dap.defaults.fallback.stepping_granularity
          Default: 'statement'

        askForTargets:
          Ask the user to step into which function if there are multiple choices.
          Only for step_into.


step_out([{opts}])                                              *dap.step_out()*
        Requests the debugee to step out of a function or method if possible.

        For options see |step_into|.

step_back([{opts}]                                             *dap.step_back()*
        Steps one step back. Debug adapter must support reverse debugging.

        For {opts} see |step_into|.

pause({thread_id})                                                 *dap.pause()*
        Requests debug adapter to pause a thread. If there are multiple threads
        it stops `thread_id` from the optional parameter or asks the user which
        thread to pause.

reverse_continue()                                      *dap.reverse_continue()*
        Continues execution reverse in time until last breakpoint.
        Debug adapter must support reverse debugging.

up()                                                                  *dap.up()*
        Go up in current stacktrace without stepping.

down()                                                              *dap.down()*
        Go down in current stacktrace without stepping.


goto_({line})                                                      *dap.goto_()*
        Let the debugger jump to a specific line or line under cursor.

        Parameters: ~
            {line}  Line number or line under cursor if nil.


repl.open({winopts}, {wincmd})                                 *dap.repl.open()*
        Open a REPL / Debug-console.

        Parameters: ~
            {winopts}  optional table which may include:
                        `height` to set the window height
                        `width` to set the window width
                        Any other key/value pair, that will be treated as window
                        option.

            {wincmd} command that is used to create the window for
                     the REPL. Defaults to 'belowright split'


        The REPL can be used to evaluate expressions. A `omnifunc` is set to
        support completion of expressions. It supports the following special
        commands:

          .exit               Closes the REPL
          .c or .continue     Same as |dap.continue|
          .n or .next         Same as |dap.step_over|
          .into               Same as |dap.step_into|
          .into_target        Same as |dap.step_into{askForTargets=true}|
          .out                Same as |dap.step_out|
          .up                 Same as |dap.up|
          .down               Same as |dap.down|
          .goto               Same as |dap.goto_|
          .scopes             Prints the variables in the current scopes
          .threads            Prints all threads
          .frames             Print the stack frames
          .capabilities       Print the capabilities of the debug adapter
          .b or .back         Same as |dap.step_back|
          .rc or
          .reverse-continue   Same as |dap.reverse_continue|

        You can customize the commands by overriding `dap.repl.commands`:
        >
          dap.repl.commands = vim.tbl_extend('force', dap.repl.commands, {
            continue = {'.continue', '.c'},
            next_ = {'.next', '.n'},
            back = {'.back', '.b'},
            reverse_continue = {'.reverse-continue', '.rc'},
            into = {'.into'},
            into_target = {'.into_target'},
            out = {'.out'},
            scopes = {'.scopes'},
            threads = {'.threads'},
            frames = {'.frames'},
            exit = {'exit', '.exit'},
            up = {'.up'},
            down = {'.down'},
            goto_ = {'.goto'},
            capabilities = {'.capabilities'},
            -- add your own commands
            custom_commands = {
              ['.echo'] = function(text)
                dap.repl.append(text)
              end
            },

VARIABLES API                                           *dap-ui-variables-api*

Lua module: dap.ui.variables


The methods listed here are in the `dap.ui.variables` module. To use them you have to import the module:

>

    local variables_ui = require('dap.ui.variables')

<


hover()                                               *dap.ui.variables.hover()*
        Opens a floating window with information about the variable under the
        cursor.

        Requires an active debug session.

scopes()                                            *dap.ui.variables.scopes()*
        Opens a hover with all variable scopes of the current frame.

        Requires an active debug session.

visual_hover()                                 *dap.ui.variables.visual_hover()*
        Opens a floating window with information on the value of the 
        current visual selection.

        Requires an active debug session.

toggle_multiline_display({value})  *dap.ui.variables.toggle_multiline_display()*
        Toggles between single and multi-line variable display in the variable
        hover window or sets multi-line display on or off when `{values}` is
        provided.

        This functionality is also available by pressing "g?" in normal mode
        in a hover window.

WIDGET API                                                    *dap-widgets*

The UI of nvim-dap is by default minimal and noninvasive, but it provides
widget primitives that can be used to build and customize a UI.

Assume you want to view all scopes within a sidebar, you can use the following:

>
  local widgets = require('dap.ui.widgets')

  local function new_sidebar(buf)
    vim.cmd('30 vsplit')
    vim.api.nvim_win_set_buf(0, buf)
    return vim.api.nvim_get_current_win()
  end

  local sidebar = widgets.builder(widgets.scopes)
                    .new_win(new_sidebar)
                    .build()
  sidebar.open()

<


If you'd further like to open the sidebar automatically each time a session
starts, you can combine this with the |dap-extensions| API explained further
below. Here's an example:

>
  dap.listeners.after['event_initialized']['your-plugin-id'] = function()
    sidebar.open()
  end

<

EXTENSIONS API                                                *dap-extensions*


nvim-dap supports subscribing and listening to all responses or events that a
debug adapter might send to nvim-dap.

There are two tables for that:

- `dap.listeners.before`
- `dap.listeners.after`

Both `before` and `after` are nested tables where the first key is
`event_<event>` for events or `<command>` for request responses. The second key
is an arbitrary key used to identify the subscription. The second key must be
unique. If you're developing a plugin, using the plugin name might be a good
option to avoid conflicts with others.

`<event>` is the name of the event.
`<command>` is the name of the command that got executed and resulted in the
response.

Please refer to the debug adapter protocol specification to get a list of all
events or requests and their response formats:

- https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/specification#Requests
- https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/specification#Events


An example:


>
  local dap = require('dap')
  dap.listeners.before['event_terminated']['my-plugin'] = function(session, body)
    print('Session terminated', vim.inspect(session), vim.inspect(body))
  end
<


Listeners registered in the `before` table are called *before* the internal `nvim-dap` handlers are called. The listeners registered in the `after` table are called *after* internal `nvim-dap` handlers.


For commands (request responses), the listeners are called with four arguments:

1. The session
2. An error: A optional table with `message` and `body` properties.
3. A table with the response. `nil` if an error occurred.
4. The original payload of the request

For events, the listeners are called with two arguments:

1. The session
2. The event payload
